## What is this?

**NEON GENESIS TERMINAL** is a native macOS app that turns your dev terminal into a NERV-style command deck. A Swift `WKWebView` wraps a self-contained dashboard: on the left, your real terminal (Claude Code or a plain shell); around it, live panels driven by *actual* data — near-earth asteroids from NASA, the orbiting satellite catalog from Celestrak, space weather from NOAA, and your own machine's vitals.

It's inspired by the "SENTRY: Near Earth Object Encounters" geocentric displays — rebuilt as something you can actually live in while you code.

> **Everything on screen is real.** The asteroids are tonight's real close approaches. The satellites are propagated from real orbital elements. The day/night terminator tracks the real solar declination. The network feed is your real traffic.

## Features

### ☄ Geocentric near-earth map (Canvas 2D, real 3D math)
- **Real asteroids** — live close-approach data from NASA NeoWs, each with its own Keplerian orbit, miss distance in lunar distances (LD), diameter, and velocity. Potentially-hazardous objects glow red.
- **1,300+ real satellites** — Starlink, GPS, OneWeb, Galileo, GLONASS, weather & GEO birds, fetched as TLEs from Celestrak and propagated client-side (Kepler solve per frame). Colored by constellation, hover to identify.
- **Live ISS** — true position from the open-notify feed, on its real ground track.
- **Day / night Earth** — a real solar-declination terminator sweeps the globe; the lit hemisphere glows amber, the night side dims to blue with city lights.
- **The real Moon** — `LUNA` is placed at its **actual geocentric position right now** (a lunar-ephemeris computation with the main perturbations), so it sits where the Moon really is relative to Earth, shows the **correct phase** (lit fraction toward the Sun), and rides its real, slowly-shifting orbit. Hover it for live distance + phase.
- **The Sun** — `SOL` rendered at its true declination with corona + rays.
- Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, hover anything for a NERV-style readout.

### 🛰 Space weather (NOAA SWPC)
Planetary K-index gauge, solar-wind speed & proton density, IMF Bz, geomagnetic storm level (QUIET → SEVERE), and an aurora-likelihood alert — straight from DSCOVR/ACE.

### 🛸 Cosmic telemetry
A header readout that's never the same twice — rotates between your civilization's live **Kardashev type** (`TYPE 0.728140 ▲`, low digits shimmering) and the **age of the universe** ticking up second by second since the Big Bang. Computed client-side, no API.

### 🖥 Embedded terminal (custom, with phosphor burn-in)
A real terminal in the main panel — **xterm.js** over a stdlib **PTY-over-WebSocket** bridge (no external terminal dependency). It's a genuine login shell, so Tab-completion, `Ctrl-R`, paste, and every other shortcut just work. Opens a **plain shell** by default; one click toggles to **Claude Code** (if `claude` is installed). With CRT mode on, **every character you type leaves a glowing phosphor burn-in that fades over ~1 second.**

### 🛰 Hubble + deep-space fleet
The **Hubble Space Telescope** is tracked on the globe from its real TLE, with a live altitude readout. The rotating telemetry line also reaches into deep space — live, ever-increasing distances to **Voyager 1 & 2**, **New Horizons**, and **Pioneer 10**, in km and light-hours.

### 🌍 The Earth reacts
- **Live aurora oval** — glowing rings around the poles, scaled by the real Kp index (they brighten and creep equatorward as geomagnetic activity climbs).
- **Earthquake pulses** — every quake from the live USGS feed sends an expanding, magnitude-colored ripple from its epicenter.
- **Next launch countdown** — the rotating readout shows the next orbital launch with a live `T-` clock.

### 📊 System monitor & network feed
btop-style CPU/MEM/NET/disk graphs, a live per-process bandwidth meter (iftop-style), and a streaming log of every outbound network connection your machine makes.

### 🟢 Heavy-CRT mode
Phosphor bloom, a rolling refresh-sweep, gentle flicker, chromatic fringing on labels, and a keypress flash — toggle it with the `▦ CRT` button (your choice is remembered). Dial it off any time for crisp readability.

### ✦ Mission extras
- **MAGI directive list** — a persistent to-do panel (MELCHIOR · BALTHASAR · CASPER).
- **Cinematic boot sequence** — a skippable NERV/MAGI bring-up on launch.
- **Run several at once** — each window auto-picks free ports, so you can fly one console per project (`nerv-dash new ~/some/project`).
- **Web-Audio sound design** — subtle UI blips and alarms (no per-event process spawning; one `AudioContext`).
- **Hex-MAGI app icon** — a glowing three-hex MAGI core with a terminal cursor.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tasty-Ramen2010/neon-genesis-terminal.git
cd neon-genesis-terminal
./install.sh            # checks deps; builds NERV.app on macOS; prompts for a NASA key
```

Then launch:

| Platform | Launch |
|----------|--------|
| **macOS** | `open /Applications/NERV.app` (native window) — or `nerv-dash` for the browser console |
| **Linux** | `nerv-dash` — or `python3 ~/.config/nerv-theme/dashboard/nerv-launch.py` |
| **Windows** | `python dashboard\nerv-launch.py` (from the repo; or use WSL for the full experience) |

Double-click any panel to make it the main view; click `⤢` for fullscreen.

### Platform support

| | Geocentric map · data · terminal | Native maximized app |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **macOS** | ✅ full | ✅ NERV.app (WKWebView) |
| **Linux** | ✅ full (system stats via `/proc`, real PTY terminal) | — (runs in your browser) |
| **Windows** | ✅ visuals + data; terminal in basic pipe mode¹ | — (runs in your browser) |

¹ The terminal uses a real PTY on macOS/Linux (full Tab-completion, TUIs, burn-in). On native Windows it falls back to a line-oriented pipe shell — fine for commands, no full-screen apps. For the full terminal on Windows, run it under **WSL**. System-stats panels on Windows use [`psutil`](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) if it's installed, otherwise they show limited values; the geocentric map, space weather, deep-space telemetry, and all the live feeds are 100% browser-side and identical everywhere.

### Dependencies
The installer checks for these and tells you how to get any you're missing:

| Tool | Why | Install |
|------|-----|---------|
| `python3` | stdlib-only backend (data sampler + HTTP + PTY terminal) — **all platforms** | preinstalled / `brew install python3` / `apt install python3` |
| Xcode CLT | `swiftc` to build the native app — **macOS only** | `xcode-select --install` |

That's it — the terminal (xterm.js) is vendored in the repo and the backend is pure Python stdlib, so there's nothing else to install. (Optional on Windows: `pip install psutil` for richer system-stats panels.)

Prefer no app? Run **`nerv-dash`** to start the services and open the console in your browser instead.

## 🔑 NASA API key (bring your own)

The asteroid feed uses NASA's free [NeoWs](https://api.nasa.gov) API. **Get your own key — it takes about 30 seconds at [api.nasa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov)** (no email confirmation). The installer will ask for it and save it to `~/.config/nerv-theme/config.json`, which is **gitignored** — your key never leaves your machine.

Resolution order: `NASA_API_KEY` env var → `~/.config/nerv-theme/config.json` → NASA's shared `DEMO_KEY`. `DEMO_KEY` works out of the box but is heavily rate-limited, so the asteroid panel may go quiet under load — that's why your own (still free) key is worth the 30 seconds.

```jsonc
// ~/.config/nerv-theme/config.json   (created by the installer; never committed)
{ "nasa_api_key": "your-free-key-here" }
```

## Architecture

```
NERV.app (Swift WKWebView, opens maximized)
        │  loads
        ▼
http://127.0.0.1:8731/  ──  nerv-server.py  (Python stdlib only)
        │                     • one background sampler thread caches all stats
        │                     • HTTP handlers only read the cache (polling never blocks)
        │                     • fetches: NASA NeoWs · Celestrak TLE (sats + Hubble) ·
        │                       NOAA SWPC · USGS quakes · Launch Library · open-notify ISS
        │                     • /pty  — WebSocket ⇄ PTY login shell (the terminal)
        ▼
nerv-dashboard.html  (vanilla JS + Canvas 2D + xterm.js, self-contained)
        │  same-origin terminal over ws://…/pty  (no ttyd, no iframe)
```

- **`nerv-dash`** — the launcher (see the command reference below).
- **`nerv-server.py`** — backend. All external fetches happen on a timer in one thread and are cached; the render loop and HTTP polling never trigger per-request work.
- **`nerv-dashboard.html`** — the entire frontend. Panels swap via CSS grid-area reassignment, so the terminal iframe never reloads when you rearrange the deck.
- The render loop throttles to ~30fps and pauses entirely when the window is hidden.
- **Multiple instances:** each window asks `nerv-dash` for a free port triplet (8731 + spares, then +10 each) and runs its own server — so consoles never collide.

---

## Commands

Everything is driven by **`nerv-dash`** (installed to `~/.local/bin`). The native app calls it for you, but you can use it directly too:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `nerv-dash` | Start services + open the console in your browser (default ports) |
| `nerv-dash new [DIR]` | **New instance** on auto-picked free ports, project root = `DIR` (or `$PWD`). Run it per project. |
| `nerv-dash serve` | Start services only, no browser (this is what `NERV.app` runs) |
| `nerv-dash status` | Show what's running on the active ports |
| `nerv-dash restart-term` | Restart just the embedded terminals |
| `nerv-dash stop` | Stop this instance (the one on `$NERV_PORT`, default 8731) |
| `nerv-dash kill` | Panic: hard-stop everything + clear stray audio |
| `nerv-dash ports` | Print the next free port triplet |
| `open /Applications/NERV.app` | Launch the native app — macOS (open it again for a second window/instance) |
| `python3 dashboard/nerv-launch.py [DIR]` | **Portable launcher** (any OS) — finds free ports, starts the server, opens your browser |

**Environment overrides** (for manual control): `NASA_API_KEY`, `NERV_PORT`, `NERV_TTYD_PORT`, `NERV_SHELL_PORT`, `NERV_PROJECT`.

```bash
# one console per project, all at once:
nerv-dash new ~/code/api      # → ports 8731/7682/7683
nerv-dash new ~/code/frontend # → ports 8741/7692/7693
```

## Controls (in-app)

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Make a panel the main view | double-click it, or use the `VIEW` bar |
| Fullscreen a panel | `⤢` button / double-click its title / `Esc` to exit |
| Orbit / zoom the globe | drag / scroll (when it's the main view) |
| Identify an object (asteroid, sat, ISS, Sun…) | hover it |
| Toggle shell ↔ Claude Code | `SHELL` / `CLAUDE` in the bar (opens a **shell** by default) |
| Toggle heavy-CRT mode | `▦ CRT` (remembered across launches) |
| Mute sound | `♪ SOUND` |
| Resize UI | `A−` / `A+` |
| Skip the boot sequence | click / any key |
